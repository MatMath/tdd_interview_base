# tdd Interview Base

## Flow:
- Find a problem
- Ask to solve it & prove it work
- Connect (export/require) with test.
- Test with edge cases
- Ask to commit.

## Example of questions to ask:
1- Write three function that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, or recursion or ES6. (kinda old, but fun for recursion)

2 - Write a function that combines two lists by alternatively taking elements.
For example: given the two lists [a, b, c] and [1, 2, 3], the function should return [a, 1, b, 2, c, 3].

3 - Prob 3, Find Fibo Number Nth.

4 - 2 object overlapping, how to get a resulting object that exclude common item.
Ex: So you want {a: 1 b: 2} vs {a: 4, c: 7} to return {b: 2, c: 7}. (a being common & excluded)

5 - How would you design a Tic Tac Toe game? & Maybe implement part of it.

6 - Fun one: (Multiply) return an array that multiply all value but itself.

Remember: Always start small & add edge cases.
